# My IT Journey

I started with curiosity and a lot of tutorials. Over time, projects became the best teachers. A few highlights:

## Frontend
- Building layouts that scale on phones first
- Accessibility checks: color contrast, keyboard nav, semantics

## DevOps
- Docker basics and why multi-stage builds help
- Small CI pipelines that lint, test, and build

```js
// a small helper I like
export function byId(id) {
  return document.getElementById(id);
}
```

Whatâ€™s next? More real-world projects, deeper testing, and learning from others.
