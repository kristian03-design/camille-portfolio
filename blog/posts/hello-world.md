# Hello, World

Welcome to my corner of the web. I’m Camille — an IT graduate exploring frontend dev and DevOps. Here I’ll share bite-sized notes from projects, things I’m learning, and the wins (and bugs) along the way.

Goals for this space:

- Consistency over perfection
- Honest notes on what works (and what doesn’t)
- Accessible and fast by default

Thanks for stopping by. More soon! ✨
